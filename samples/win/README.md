Example windows challenge:

* build the challenge container in the cloud (see challenge/Makefile)
* change the deployment in config/advanced/deployment/containers.yaml to run on windows
* since the example is running iis, change the port to port 80 in config/advanced/network/network.yaml and containers.yaml
